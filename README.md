## What is BUMP?
BUMP is a contact sharing application that utilizes the Apple watch's sensors and the Iphones bluetooth capabilities to trade 
contacts via a fist bump.

### Setup (IMPORTANT: Due to Apple's Organization ID's it is currently not possible to Demo)
Clone repo to your local Mac device. You'll need Xcode installed to install the BUMP application to your Iphone and Apple Watch.
Once you have the local repo cloned and your Iphone connected via lightning connector to your Mac device you can
begin installing the application. 

### Installing BUMP Demo Iphone
Choose what device (your Iphone) you want to run the project simulation (in Xcode) on then run
the project file. This will install the application on your Iphone.

### Installing BUMP Demo Apple Watch
Once the application is installed on your Iphone the watch app will detect BUMP as an application that can be installed onto
your Apple watch!

NOTE: Your Iphone and your Apple watch MUST have developer mode enabled in the settings!
